# Remote-controllable-irrigation-system
## Irrigation system project I realized using Arduino Macro, Hc-05 bluetooth module, Soil Moisture Sensor and Flutter Mobile application.
**Project Purpose:** It is a project that allows the user to transmit the moisture in the soil to the mobile application and the Arduino macro microcontroller via the Bluetooth module and water the plant with the given irrigation command. The project aims to control the plant remotely.
